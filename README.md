# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview of the analysis
* Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures.
* The company has just received a  dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects. Independent Funding wants an ETL process to be performed on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.
* In this Challenge,  Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks were used to do the extract and transform phases. 
* Specifically, the analysis required the extract and transformation of the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. 
* Next step was the load phase. Specifically,the dataset was used to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. The CSV file was uploaded that contains the backers’ information into this table. 
* Finally, a data analysis was performed on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
